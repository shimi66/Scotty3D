--- A1.0 ---

Task A1T1:
	Fully implemented.

Task A1T2:
	Everything is fully implemented, except for a few cases where the start point and end point may be within a 
	diamond in A1T2. Pretty much, the smaller the distance between the  two points, the more trouble my implementation 
	had. I wsa not sure how to create helper functions in c++ until the last day, so A1T2 became very large and confusing
	and as I didn't have enough time to go back in and fix everything. Thus I know that there are some issues with this section.

Task A1T3:
	Fully implemented.

--- A1.5 ---

Task A1T4:

Task A1T5:
